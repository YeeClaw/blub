Blub
----------------
Blub is a simple discord but that I created to manage various discord tasks amongst me and my friends.
Here are some core features:
- Rich integration with minecraft servers and a slew of utility commands
- A websocket client used to interface with the SpiderSockey server to manage in game events and triggers
